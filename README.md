# cub3D

## Project Description
***"Summary: This project is inspired by the world-famous eponymous 90’s game, which
was the first FPS ever. It will enable you to explore ray-casting. Your goal will be to
make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which you’ll have to find your way."***

## Instructions
